<h3>Facts About Fake News That You Need to Know in 2021</h3>

<h2>What Is Fake News?</h2>

<p>Fake news can broadly be defined as false information. It is comprised of information designed to mislead readers, for either social, political, or financial gain.</p>

<h2>It can be defined into two categories;</h2>

<p>Stories that are false. There are fake stories that have been deliberately made up, usually as a marketing ploy to buy a product or to support a campaign.
Stories that stray from the truth. Some stories contain a little bit of truth but are not 100% accurate. This is a biased form of fake news that aims to persuade people of a particular ideological or political viewpoint.</p>

<h2>How Long Has Fake News Been Around?</h2>

<p>The concept of fake news has been around for centuries, as we humans have always loved to gossip. The term ‘fake news’ was brought into the spotlight in the 2016 US presidential race involving Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, where Donald Trump famously claimed accusations against him were merely ‘fake news. </p>

<p>The Growth in Fake News
In the past century, the growth in fake news has been exponential. From humble beginnings with ill-fact checked newspapers, to the increase in the magazine industry. Chain emails became popular in the early 2000s, and the threat of social media has become the focal point for fake news today.
Over the past 20 years, it has become increasingly easier to share information, both true and false, and more recently, on a larger scale. Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat act as catalysts. Today, the false material can ‘go viral’ before anything is even fact-checked.</p>

<h2>How Can It Spread?</h2>

<p>With modern technology, fake news can be circulated instantaneously. It can be spread via initial miss-information, spiraling to become a web of fake news across the internet. Multiple publications can report on the same piece of false information which then appears to another author as being verified by numerous sources. An example of this is when a 1998 paper on how routine child vaccinations can lead to autism, inspired an entire anti-vaccination movement.

Despite critics discrediting the article later, the original paper was used as a source for multiple papers to follow, making the web impossible to unravel. As more user come to rely upon external information, an unverified fact can make its way into an article which may later be added as a citation.</p>

<h2>Can You Trust Your Local News?</h2>

<p>Since the advent of the fake news phenomenon, the trust levels in news outlets has dropped significantly. According to the Reuters Institute For The Study Of Journalism, trust levels in the news vary by country. The study found that people in the West are more inclined to trust their media sources due to having well-funded broadcasters. The highest level of trust was seen in Finland with 62%, while trust levels in American news organizations reached only 38%.</p>

<p>Developing A Critical Mindset Is The First Step To Detecting Fake News
Fake news can often be persuasive, hence why it is such a big issue in today’s society. Many fake news stories are written to create ‘shock’ value or to impress the reader. This is why developing a critical mindset is essential to keep your emotional response to such stories, in check. </p>
