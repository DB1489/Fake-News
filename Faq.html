<h2>Where Does Fake News Come From?</h2>
<p>While the presence of fake news is not new, the internet and social media changed the ways it’s created and spread. Fake news is a multi-step process that involves making or taking content that others have produced, passing it off as real news, and capitalizing on social media to get as much attention as possible. This section explains how purveyors of fake news operate, and how fake news is created. It provides a step-by-step guide to how fake news producers utilize the internet and social media.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, those who operate fake news websites want as many visitors to their sites as possible. While some may want their visitors to see the content and have it influence their political values, others simply want internet users to click on them, which often takes users to a website where users see more content (ideological or not) and/or see advertising. When a website has ads on it, those visits pay the website owner advertising revenue. Both of these motivations—ideological and commercial--need as many people to click on the website link and visit as possible. With this in mind, let’s go through the steps that go into creating a fake news factory.</p> 

<h2>Why We Fall for Fake News</h2>
<p>Why do people fall prey to fake news stories? Can't they just tell when they come across them? Having such easy access to real facts and fact checkers surely takes care of the problem, right? Unfortunately, part of the reason that fake news is such a problem is that people do fall for these stories, and being shown the facts doesn’t help correct this problem. This is due to a feature of human thinking called cognitive biases. A cognitive bias is a gap in reasoning, remembering, or evaluating something that can lead to mistaken conclusions. They’re universal. Everyone has them.</p>

<p>This section explains how cognitive biases operate—what goes in inside people's heads that makes us more likely to fall for fake news, and for us to continue to believe false information even after it's been corrected.</p>

<p>Cognitive biases result from the automatic mental shortcuts that humans naturally take on a daily basis. Normally, these shortcuts make our lives easier. You don't need to re-learn your path from home to work or school every day; it’s become so ingrained in your mind that you can follow it almost without thinking. This "automatic process" allows us to conserve mental energy that we could use for things that are more complicated [1]. At the same time, cognitive biases can cause mistakes in our thinking, too. These biases can act as blind spots, leading you not to realize something that may be apparent. They can also make one part of your mental perspective play a disproportionate role in your thinking. A common example of this is younger people mistakenly believing they don't need health insurance because they are healthy generally [2]. This seems perfectly logical to a healthy person, but overlooks the possibility of catastrophic events.</p>
